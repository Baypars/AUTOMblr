Automate batch posts to Tumblr from local directories

Problem: I maintain a fashion blog on Tumblr, I often found myself downloading pictures that I liked from other blogs(not ones on Tumblr) and posting them to Tumblr. I recognized that there were also actions that I repeatedly did after each post: such as keeping a record of already posted pictures, captioning/tagging brand names and seasons, etc. As these things were pretty mechanical and robotic I decided to automate the process using the Tumblr API. By attaching the directory (where the content is), you can automate the whole posting process by writing a one line script that posts contents for you in one click.

            python "C:/link/to/python/file.py"
